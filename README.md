# Game Introduction
As you can understand from the name of the game. It's basic Darkest Dungeon game. In my project, There are 2 teams and each team have 4 member which name hero and monster. Heroes and monsters have different members which have different skills. Some of this skills for supporting teammates like buffing or healing, others for attacking which gives damage to enemies. Also move skills, for usage of skills can change location by location and some skills changes enemies location
